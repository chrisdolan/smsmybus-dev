HTML page to help the user find the next buses for a specific location.

Plan for this subproject:
 * let user specify a location
   - via HTML5 geolocation
   - picking from a map
   - typing a location, resolved via a map search API?
 * checkbox to remember choice (cookie)
   - and possibly local storage caching the mapping of (lat/long -> stop) data to save some server queries
 * from that location, find nearby stops
   - if user is within, say, 30 ft of a stop then just use that one
 * show next arriving buses at that stop/those stops
 * let user narrow list by:
   - selecting a single stop from several
   - use heading to distinguish, say, westbound from eastbound buses -- user has to point the phone the way they want to go
